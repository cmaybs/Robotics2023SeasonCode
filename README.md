# Robotics2023SeasonCode
Files from onBotJava, these are from our 22/23 season, adapted for 23/24. Files are in .blk and .java file types.

claire was here, she was.

Linked below are some notebooks on google colab regarding tensorflow and tensor flow lite model building and other resources:

Model training example: (this distinguishes between penguins)
https://colab.research.google.com/github/tensorflow/docs/blob/master/site/en/tutorials/customization/custom_training_walkthrough.ipynb

Model training portal that can be adapted for our own needs: (all in python, Janet has resources on this in her notion, ask her!)
https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1BSspdZfMFSuNaApmbVgsZwzsngi8qrWb#scrollTo=3jz5x0JoskPv

Other further, and broader resources on tenorflow:
--> look here first https://ftc-docs.firstinspires.org/en/latest/programming_resources/vision/tensorflow_pp_2022/tensorflow_pp_2022.html
https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/customization/custom_training_walkthrough


---> next steps figure out how to adapt these to use for our needs (off a notebook and on an android device)
